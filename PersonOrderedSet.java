TODO	Write a class named, PersonOrderedSet. This class should extend PersonSet and override the add method to 
add Persons in alphabetical order by name. 
*/

/*
TODO You are strongly encouraged to use super.add(p) in PersonOrderedSet.add and then perform a sort of the data to make sure 
everything is in order. You are allowed to use the built-in Collections.sort method, but in order to make it work, Person 
will need to implement the Comparable interface and implement a compareTo method (Youâ€™re encouraged to look this up.). 
You may also look up and modify a bubblesort or other sorting technique for solving this problem.
