TODO	Write a class named, PersonImperialSet. This class should extend PersonSet and override the add method to 
convert the height measurement from centimeters to inches and the weight from kilograms to pounds. (Look up the
 conversions online.)
 */
 
 /*
 TODO You must use super.add(p) as the final step in PersonImperialSet.add after the conversion has been completed. (Assuming that 
p is a variable referring to a Person object to be added to the set.)
