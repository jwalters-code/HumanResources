/*
	Write a class named, PersonSet, that implements the interface PersonList. Use an ArrayList and fill in the 
	add and get methods. You may not use any built in Set-type Java classes.
	
TO DO	In addition to implementing add and get methods, PersonSet must make sure that no duplicate Persons are added. 
	If you want to use the ArrayListâ€™s built-in contains method to make this easier, you will need to add an equals 
	method to Person. See below for more details.
	
	If you want to use the ArrayList's contains method to see if a Person is already in the set, then you 
need to make sure that Person overrides the default equals method. To do so, fill in the following comment
outline and also refer to this resource for more information:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overriding-equals-method-in-java/
//Equals method outline
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o)
{
	//if Object o is null then return false

	//if Object o == this then return true

	//if Object o is not an instance of Person then return false

//Declare a new variable of type Person (perhaps named p) 
//	and assign it to Object o cast as type Person

//if Person p has the same name, height, and weight as 
//	this then return true
//else return false
}
